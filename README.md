The following is the definition of the variable EAP which is a dictionary data type (dict) and which holds student data for PLS60:
EAP = { 
   "PLS60":{ 
      "student1":{ 
                 "name":"Mike",
                 "grades":{ 
                          "PLS50":9.5,
                          "PLS51":7
                  }
      },
      "student2":{ 
                 "name":"Jill",
                 "grades":{ 
                          "PLS50":8.5,
                          "PLS51":9
                  }
      },
      "student3":{ 
                 "name":"Alice",
                 "grades":{ 
                          "PLS50":6.5,
                          "PLS51":8.2
                  }
      },
      "student4":{ 
                 "name":"Jill",
                 "grades":{ 
                          "PLS50":8.5,
                          "PLS51":9
                  }
      }
   } 
} 

Give an expression which, if executed, will display on the screen the grade obtained by student3 in PLS51.
